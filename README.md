Personalized Medicine - Redefining the Cancer Treatment

Much has been said in recent years about how precision medicine, and more specifically, genetic testing, will disrupt the treatment of diseases such as cancer.
But this is still only partially happening due to the huge amount of manual labor still needed. In this project, we will try to bring personalized medicine to its full potential.
Once sequenced, a cancerous tumor can have thousands of genetic mutations. The challenge is to distinguish mutations that contribute to tumor growth from mutations.
Currently, this interpretation of genetic mutations is being done manually. This is a very time consuming task where a clinical pathologist has to manually review and classify each genetic mutation based on evidence from the text-based clinical literature.
For this project, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) is providing an expert-noted knowledge base where world-class researchers and oncologists have manually noted thousands of mutations.
In this project, a learning algorithm was developed.
Machine that, using this knowledge base as a baseline, automatically classifies genetic variations.
